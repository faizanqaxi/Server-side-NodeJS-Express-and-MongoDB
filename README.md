# Server-side-NodeJS-Express-and-

* Developed a server side web application for a restaurant from scratch
* Made a RESTful API with security and authentication
* Used MongoDB database, Routing, OAuth, Cookies, Sessions and More

The server uses OAuth with facebook for Authentication so you need to register your app at "developers.facebook.com"
After that update config.js file accordingly
